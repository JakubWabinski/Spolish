# Vocabulary_app
Just a basic quiz-like app for learning Spanish vocabulary. Based on my repository of words/expressions from Spanish classes. The app randomly chooses a word - either in Spanish or Polish, and asks user to write his/her translation.

# 21.12.2020
Uploaded the very alpha version that works: loads CSV with words, modifies the input to a proper pandas DataFrame, asks for input and provides a result.

FUTURE AMENDMENTS: 
1. Provide more optional translations/spellings to exhaust all the possible versions of user's input
2. Detect typos and inform user about this fact
3. Provide scoring
4. Include graphic interface
